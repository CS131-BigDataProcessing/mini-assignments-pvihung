#Because I am unable to work on dockerfile using Git Bash, so I will work on this assignment using this txt file, 

Step 1: Create the dockerfile
# Start with a base image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy all files from the current directory to the container's /app directory
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies from requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Run the app (replace app.py with your main script)
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

Step 2: Build image 
docker build -t my-python-app .

Step 3: Run image
docker run my-python-app
